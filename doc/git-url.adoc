NAME
----
git-url - Generate, decode base-1024 Unicode urls

SYNOPSIS
--------
git url [-h] [-q] [-r <revision>] [-u <url>] [-p <path>] [gitu://...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This git subcommand uses base-1024 encoding and Huffman codes to compress
repository fetch-URL, revision and optionally a file path into Unicode
string utilizing Unicode letters.

By using glyphs that are **letters**, not symbols it is guaranteed that
double clicking on resulting URL (called *giturl*) will select whole
string. If there would be a symbol, like `+` used in base-64 encoding,
selection would stop before it.

Other subcommand **git-guclone(1)** can be used to clone from giturl and
checkout encoded revision, also decode and display encoded file path.

OPTIONS
-------

-h::
Displays usage information.

-q::
Quiet mode of operation, shows only resulting url or one-line decoded data.

-r <revision>::
Encoding - don't fetch current revision from repository, set it to **<revision>**.

-u <url>::
Encoding - don't fetch URL from repository, set it to **<url>**.

-p <path>::
Encoding - encode file path **<path>** in resulting giturl. Suggested is to
use tilde **~** to separate multiple file names.

[gitu://...]::
Decoding - optional giturl for decoding, passing it means decoding is intended.
The url doesn't have to be prefixed with gitu://, it can be also prefixed with //,
and have no prefix at all.
